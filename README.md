## Overview

This repository contains my solution to the "Newsletter sign-up form with success message" challenge from Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if the field is left empty or the email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (responsive)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Custom properties, Flexbox, Responsive layout / media queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (form validation and success-state handling)
- Local fonts (Roboto)

### What I learned

- Implementing client-side form validation using a regular expression to check if an email is formatted correctly.
- Using JavaScript to toggle UI states (showing and dismissing a success message after submission).
- Loading and using local fonts with @font-face declarations for consistent typography.
- Creating a mobile-first responsive layout using a flexible container and media queries.

### Continued development

- Improve accessibility (add ARIA attributes, focus trapping, and keyboard navigation for the success dialog).
- Fix the small bug in the `dismiss` handler and refine the success/dismiss flow logic.
- Add subtle animations and keyboard accessible focus states for better UX.
